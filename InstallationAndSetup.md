# how do we install Pyodel?

# Installing plugin\_pyodel #

You'll have Pyodel installed before you can say _Holleree_ (if you can't, don't worry)

web2py plugins are a piece-of-cake to install:

  * Download the plugin installer in your system from the [downloads section](http://code.google.com/p/pyodel/downloads/list)
  * Open your web2py admin interface and go to your app's admin panel (click the _edit_ below the app's name in _sites_)
  * In the lower plugin section click in the upload plugin field and set the route to the downloaded plugin installer's
  * That's it, you have installed Pyodel within your app space

# Setup #

This is even more easy. By now, the plugin has no initial configuration commands. You just have to enter the setup function once so Pyodel loads the demo.

Use this url (replacing `<`app`>` with the actual url) in the browser for runing the initial setup

`<`app`>`/plugin\_pyodel/setup


This way you can test the different components using the different demo data as courses, lectures, documents, streams and quizzes.

**Pyodel** is an e-learning multipurpose tool for web2py that will allow
e-learning general CRUD operations with RBAC (manager, teacher,
student, ...), make and perform student tests and qualifications,
support class streaming with access control, and class documentation
sharing with markmin.

It is intended as a simple tool for schools and
single courses, to interact as plugin with other apps such as CMS
projects or in standalone app mode.

The name is inspired in the very funny Loriot sketch about the [German yodeling school](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lliHC7QSiG8)

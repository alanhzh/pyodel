# how to explore the plugin features with the appspot demo

### First step: (free) registration ###

To start using the demo, you must be a registered user (as in almost any other web2p app out there)

  * Visit the demo page at http://pyodel.appspot.com
  * Go to register (upper right corner)
  * Fill the form
  * That's it. You are a new Pyodel demo student

### How to use the students interface ###

  * Click in the link Student desk at the index demo page
  * You should be provided with a set of buttons to access the different default demo resources
  * If you click in the Yodel course, you will access to a course description, with a list of available streams, lessons and documents.

Clicking on each button will show the resource inside an area called workspace, which is somewhere in the middle of the document body.
If you want, you can get rid of the resource in the page by using the right **clear** or **show/hide** buttons. Clearing a resource will erease it from the current page, while showing/hiding a resource leaves it available to continue using it (it will not be necessary to load it again by clicking in the resource button).

By default, when you click in a resource, some elements of the page will hide, so you have extra space for it.

Clicking in a document will leave the current page and open the web2py wiki interface with the selected resource.
Note that users can add their own wiki pages (by using the upper menu bar wiki commands) and explore the app's wiki directory. You can return to it with the student desk link in the index page.
